# Tag: Not it!

Two users are chosen at random by the bot. One is the Master and the other is the Puppet. Their identity is a secret. The Master's job is to come up with a word or phrase, which is delivered to the bot. The bot then relays this phrase to the Puppet, who has 24 hours to use that phrase in a comment on this subreddit.

After the phrase has been placed by the Puppet, it must go unnoticed for 24 hours. The users who are not either the Master or the Puppet can reply "!you're it" under a comment to guess if that comment was made by the Puppet and contains the phrase. But be careful! You only get to use that once a round.

The goal of the Master is to come up with a phrase weird enough that the Puppet will stick out like a sore thumb when they use it. The Puppet's goal is to work the phrase into a comment in a way that other won't arise suspiscion from the other users. All the other users in the subreddit will try to look for suspicious comments to tag.

If the Puppets comment is correctly called out by a user then the Master wins and a new Puppet is chosen. If the Puppet uses the phrase and no one identifies it, then the Puppet wins and they become the Master for the next round.

## Rules:
* The phrase can be no longer than 3 words
* Both roles have 24 hours to accept their role before it is given to a new user
* Once both roles have accepted and the Master submits their phrase, the Puppet has 24 hours to use the phrase
* The Puppet's comment must be made on a post that was created after the round started
* If the Puppet doesn't use the phrase in that window, then the Master wins by default
* If the phrase is not found within 24 hours of it being used, then the Puppet wins

## Upcomming Features:
* Term limit for Masters
* Scoring system
* Additional roles?

# Tag: Not it!

Two users are chosen at random by the bot. One is the Master and the other is the Puppet. The other users are not told their identity. The goal of the Master is to come up with a phrase weird enough that the Puppet will stick out like a sore thumb when they use it. The Puppet's goal is to work the phrase into a comment in a way that won't arise suspiscion from the other users. All the other users in the subreddit are trying to identify the Puppet's comment.

After the Puppet has used the phrase, their comment must go unnoticed for 24 hours. The other users can reply "!you're it" under a comment to tag it. If that comment was made by the Puppet and contains the phrase, then the user's guess was correct and the Master wins the round. Users need to guess wisely though. They can only tag one comment per round.

If the Puppet's comment is correctly tagged by a user, then the Master wins and a new Puppet is chosen at random. If the Puppet uses the phrase and no user identifies it, then the Puppet wins and they become the Master for the next round.

## Rules:
* The phrase can be no longer than 3 words
* Both roles have 24 hours to accept their role before it is given to a new user
* Once both roles have accepted and the Master submits their phrase, the Puppet has 24 hours to use the phrase
* The Puppet's comment must be made on a post that was created after the round started
* If the Puppet doesn't use the phrase within 24 hours of it being set, then the Master wins by default

## Upcomming Features:
* Term limit for Masters
* Scoring system
* Additional roles?

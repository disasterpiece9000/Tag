Two users are chosen at random by the bot. One is the Master and the other is the Puppet. Their identity is a secret. The Master's job is to come up with a word or phrase, which is delivered to the bot. The bot then relays this phrase to the Puppet, who has 24 hours to use that phrase in a comment on this subreddit.

The users who are not either the Master or the Puppet can reply "!you're it" under a comment to guess if that comment was made by the Puppet and contains the phrase. But be careful! You only get to use that once a round.

If the Puppets comment is correctly called out by a user then the Master wins and a new Puppet is chosen. If the Puppet uses the phrase and no one identifies it, then the Puppet wins and they become the Master for the next round.

## Rules:
* The phrase can be no longer than 3 words
* Both roles have 24 hours to accept their role before it is given to a new user
* Once both roles have accepted and the Master submits their phrase, the Puppet has 24 hours to use the phrase
* The Puppet's comment must be made on a post that was created after the round started
* If the Puppet doesn't use the phrase in that window, then the Master wins by default
* If the phrase is not found within 24 hours of it being used, then the Puppet wins
